Internship_Project
==================

The project was to provide a PaaS solution on top of an IaaS so that the end user could focus on app development 
rather than focusing on other aspects of app development such as load balancing, profiling etc. 
The IaaS layer used was IceHouse Openstack and PaaS solution deployed on top of it was CloudFoundry.
