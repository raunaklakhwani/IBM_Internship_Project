Move the ronak folder on the root directory of the BOSH_CLI VM.

Controllers IP ---------- 9.114.96.250
Compute IP -------------- 9.114.96.150

Before proceeding to use the script, pls remove the controllers and compute ip with your controller and compute ip respectively.

After removing the controllers and compute IP with your environment IPs, you need to configure certain properties of microbosh VM installation.
1. echo "<microbosh_vm_ip> 10.241.0.3" >> key.txt
2. echo -e "admin\nadmin\n" |  bosh target https://10.241.0.3:25555 
   In this line , replace 10.241.0.3 with the static IP of the microbosh VM which you have freely available in your network allocation pool.


After this you come to the installation of different components of CF.
Configure this section of demo.yml
subnets:
      - name: Subnet_1
        range: 10.241.0.0/22
        gateway: 10.241.0.1
        static:
          - 10.241.0.4 - 10.241.0.254


1. echo "<nats_static_ip> 9.114.98.xxx" >> temp.txt
2. echo "<postgres_static_ip> 9.114.98.xxx" >> temp.txt
3. echo "<router_ip_address> 9.114.98.xxx" >> temp.txt

Replace the above 3 lines with the 3 floating IP addresses available in your pool. They should not be bound to any VMs.

After this you come to the installation of pushing an app to the CF.
1. cf target http://api.9.114.98.169.xip.io --trace
Replace this with the IP assigned to router in the CF installation.
